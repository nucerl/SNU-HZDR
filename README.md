# Inlet Turbulent Boundary Conditions Calculator

# Prepared by: Erol Bicer - SNU

Description: 
Initially, the code employs the pipe flow correlation to obtain an approximate value for Turbulent Intensity (Ti). Then, it iteratively computes the Ti until the turbulent viscosity equals the molecular viscosity. Subsequently, the calculated Ti is incremented and decremented to determine the inlet k and epsilon.
